	<h1>The overall user experience</h1>
	<h3>Usability</h3>
	<p>There are certain situations, both user-oriented or independent, in which different solutions work better. Splitting the heading dropdown into separate buttons does certainly speed up the access, while at the same time taking up more space. It is up to the user to decide, whether easier accessability prevails over tidy toolbar.</p>
	<h3>Personal preference</h3>
	<p>Usability and editing needs might be one of the factors, but still there is the personal preference - the user's previous experience and habits might come forth and be a decisive factor.</p>
	<h3>Flexibility</h3>
	<p>Whatever the reason may be to use both the standard heading dropdown list or the separate heading toolbar buttons, <a href="https://ckeditor.com">CKEditor 5</a> WYSIWYG editor offers both of these options for greater comfort of rich-text edition and user satisfaction.</p>
