## Link protocol

This test checks whether:
- `config.link.defaultProtocol` applies.
- user is able to dynamically change the link protocol (just as an extended example of usage).
- the plugin dynamically change link protocol to `mailto:` when email address was detected.

When you dynamically change the value of the link protocol, the form input placeholder should change as well.
