# Ticket test: [#8412](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues/8412)

1. Align the table to the left

Expected:

* All nested levels of the list are indented (relative to themselves and the paragraph).
* The content of the list wraps around the table (only separate points).
* The bullet is always visible.
* The text alignment line of multiline points has no indentation.
