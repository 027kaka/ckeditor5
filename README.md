This repository contains the development version of CKEditor 5, the next generation WYSIWYG editing platform and solutions.

## Current Status

**WARNING**: Development just started and this repository still doesn't contain usable software.

## Key Repositories

The [ckeditor5-design](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-design) repository concentrates the whole design effort around CKEditor 5. Information can be found at its [wiki](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-design/wiki) and [issues](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-design/issues) pages.

The [ckeditor5](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5) repository instead centralizes the official code produced by the project. Code available here should be pretty much final. Its [issues](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-design/issues) page is the place where to report issues regarding releases features and about the project as a whole.
