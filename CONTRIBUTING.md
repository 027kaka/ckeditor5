Contributing
========================================

## Fixing Issues / Coding Features

It is all about software, so the most optimal way to contribute is by coding.

Infrastructure and a well defined workflow is in place to handle code contributions, based on GitHub Pull Requests: [https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pulls](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/pulls).

Things to keep in mind:

* We expect contributions to follow the [high-quality code standards that we follow](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5-design/wiki#coding), including coding style and tests. Lack of attention to this point may either make it slow to adopt a contribution or even force us to reject it altogether.
* There is no guarantee that your contribution will be incorporated in the main code. Still pull requests make it easy for you to keep them for your own use or for others which may be interested on them.
* Having a CLA is essential to have your contributions accepted (see bellow).

## Translating

Being this a project with global impact, contributing translations is both an easy and powerful way to help.

We use the Transifex service for translations at the following address: [https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ckeditor/](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/ckeditor/).

Here as well, having a CLA in place is a requirement to become an official translator (see bellow).

## Reporting Issues / Requesting Features

The easiest way to contribute is by simply reporting issues that you find in our project. We use the following GitHub page to track and manage them: [https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues).

Things to keep in mind:

* Search for existing issues before starting a new one. This helps our team to have the backlog  in order.
* Be concise and informative, making it easy for our team to understand the problem.
* Do not use the issues pages for asking for help.
* Feel free to jump into discussions around issues, exposing your opinion.

The issues pages can be used for feature requests.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To accept contributions sent to us in form of code, documentation or translations, a Contributor License Agreement (CLA) must be in place in order to clarify the intellectual property license granted with them. This license is for your protection as a contributor as well as the protection of us and our users; it does not change your rights to use your own contributions for any other purpose.

To sign the CLA and to have more information, please follow this link: [http://ckeditor.com/cla](http://ckeditor.com/cla).
