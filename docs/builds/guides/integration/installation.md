## Download options

The goal of installing any of the CKEditor 5 builds is enabling you to using its API when integrating it inside your application. For that purpose, several options are available:

* [Zip download](#zip-download)
* [CDN](#cdn)
* [npm](#npm)

Each of the builds have independent release packages. Before starting, you must define which one youâ€™re interested on. Check the Overview page for the list of available builds.

### Zip download

Go to http://ckeditor.com/ckeditor5-builds/download and download the build your prefered build. For example, you may download the `ckeditor5-build.classic-1.0.0.zip` file for the Classic Editor build.

Extract the above zip file into a dedicated directory inside your website/application.

The main entry point script will be then available are `<your-path>/ckeditor/build/ckeditor.js`.

### CDN

Builds can be loaded inside pages directly from our CDN, which is optimized for worldwide super-fast speed download.

Check out the {@link TODO CKEditor 5 Builds CDN website} for a list of URL entry points for the builds API.

### npm

All builds are released on npm. The following search shows all build packages available there: https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=%40ckeditor%2Fckeditor5-build

Installing a build with npm is as simple as calling the following inside your website/application:

```
npm install --save @ckeditor/ckeditor5-build-classic
```

The script entry point for the build class will be found then at `node_modules/ckeditor5-build-classic/build/ckeditor.js`.

## Included Files

The following are the main files available in all build distributions:

* `build/ckeditor.js`: the main UMD distribution script, containing the editor core and all plugins. Compatible with ECMAScript 6 enabled browsers. A smaller download.
* `build/ckeditor.compat.js`: the same as the above, for browsers not compatible with ES6.
* `ckeditor.js`: the source entry point of the build. Can be used for complex bundling and development.

## Loading the API

Once downloaded and installed in your application, it is time to make the API available in your pages. For that purpose, it is enough to load the API entry point script:

```
<script src="/ckeditor/build/ckeditor.js"></script>
```

For a more advanced setup, you may wish to bundle the CKEditor script with other scripts used by your application. See {@link TODO Bundling} for more information about it.

Once the CKEditor script is loaded, you can {@link TODO use the API} to create editors in your page.
