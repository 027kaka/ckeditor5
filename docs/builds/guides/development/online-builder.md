# Creating custom builds

A build is a simple [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) package (usually developed in a Git repository) with a predefined set of dependencies. Out of this repository, distribution files can be generated through the build process.

Some of the reasons for creating custom builds are:

* Adding features which are not included in the existing builds, either from a third party or custom developed.
* Removing unnecessary features present in a build.
* Changing the {@link builds/guides/integration/basic-api#creating-an-editor editor creator}.
* Changing the {@link framework/guides/theme-customization editor theme}.
* Changing the {@link features/ui-language localization language} of the editor.
* Enabling bug fixes which are still not a part of any public release.

This is where the online builder comes to aid the users needs.

# Online builder

The [online builder](https://ckeditor.com/ckeditor-5/online-builder/) lets you download CKEditor 5 builds and also allows you to create your own, customized builds (with a different set of plugins) in a few easy steps, through a simple and intuitive UI.

 Refer to the documentation to check what kind of editor suits your needs. Once you choose the desired editor type, press the **Next step** button.

 For the sake of clarity, this guide will use the Classic build as an example.

## Choosing plugins

The basic build come with a predefined set of plugins. Take a moment to check these options out. You can freely remove those, that will not be used in your build.

Below the preselected plugins, you will find a large collection of features that can be added to the custom build. Choose the one you need.

Once you choose all the desired plugins, press the **Next step** button.

## Toolbar composition

Next step allows you to compose the toolbar. A simple drag-and-drop workspace allows for adding buttons representing the chosen plugins to the toolbars. The user may change the order of the buttons and group them accordingly.

	Note that some of the buttons are pre-placed and are grayed out. To move one of these, drag them from the lower bar into the upper bar - they will become focused and can be moved around.

Once you design the toolbar, press the **Next step** button.

## Choosing the defaut language

This is simply - just scroll the list of available languages and check the one you want to be the main editor language.
