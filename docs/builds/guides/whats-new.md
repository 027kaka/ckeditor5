## Enhanced UX

### Better images

Inserting images inside the contents is now very intuitive, with all technical aspects (uploading, resizing) hidden from the user experience. No more complex dialogs.

The outdated concept of image “alignment” has been dropped, introducing image “styles” instead:

### Simple linking

No more complex dialogs for linking.

### Auto formatting

Start lists, headings and even bold text by typing.

## Enhancement in the classic editor

### New toolbar

The toolbar is now always visible when the user scrolls the page down.

### Inlined contents

The contents of the editor are now placed inline in the page. It’s much easier to style them. Additionally, the editor grows with the contents (or not, it’s up to you!).

## Less features == Better content

We focused on creating a tool for writing quality content. At the same time, we simplified the integration of the editor into your system.

We had way too many features and configurations, which were confusing developers and at the same time negatively impacting on the end user experience. Misleading formatting tools have been removed, dialogs stripped out or simplified and well designed features that require no configuration.

## Lightweight

The editor is much more lightweight and fast. It brings a great user experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Highly customizable

CKEditor 5 Builds are based on the {@link TODO CKEditor 5 Framework}, which gives powerful customizability and extensibility possibilities.

## Custom data model

A much more efficient data model has been designed in CKEditor 5, making the development of features a much more creative experience and enhancing features like undo and redo.

## Collaborative editing

Another important benefit of our custom data model is that it enables the possibility of real-time collaborative editing inside CKEditor, by introducing the concepts of “operations” and “operational transformations”. Read more about {@link TODO collaboration in the CKEditor 5 Framework documentation}.

## Modern

CKEditor 5 has been totally rewritten in ES6, using the power of modules. It provides all the necessary tools to easily integrate it with modern applications and technologies, like Angular, React, Node.js, npm, etc.
