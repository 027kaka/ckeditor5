</info-box>

## Features availability

Most of the features are included in CKEditor Builds and available out of the box, like for example {@link features/autoformat Autoformatting}
or {@link features/keyboard-support Keyboard support}. However some of the presented features need to be manually included 
in a customized CKEditor build, for example the {@link features/markdown Markdown processor} which outputs markdown instead of HTML.

## Looking for more?

The examples on the left do not present all features included in CKEditor 5. For example some end user features like bulleted & numbered lists are quite self-explanatory.

Please bear in mind that the stable version of CKEditor 5 has not been officially released yet, with time more features will be added to CKEditor 5. If you are missing anything particular, feel free to [suggest a new feature](https://github.com/ckeditor/ckeditor5/issues) and share with us your feedback. If it has been already reported by someone, upvote it to show your support. 

## How about creating own features?

Probably the most exciting features are the one you can develop on top of CKEditor 5 Framework!
We are slowly enhancing the {@link framework/index CKEditor 5 Framework documentation}, together with {@link api/index API documentation} hoping to give you a solid base for {@link framework/guides/quick-start#Creating-a-simple-plugin creating own features}.

The addons community in case of CKEditor 4 resulted in an impressive number of over 300 addons created and published by the community. Now it's time for CKEditor 5!
