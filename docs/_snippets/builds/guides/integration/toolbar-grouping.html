<h2>The space race</h2>

<p>It is no longer a secret &mdash; though it was for a long time &mdash; that the Soviet Union raced the United States to the Moon and only in the knowledge of their own failure did they focus all their brilliant minds and hard work on the orbital station program known widely as Salyut. The reason for their failure, we learned in the late 1990&rsquo;s, was the lack of a proper plan. And, as some sources suggest, the absence of a real need to achieve the goal. It was the US president&rsquo;s challenge, cast in front of an audience, that the Americans will put a man on the face of Luna before the end of the decade.</p>

<p>The Soviets, who have so far been winning in everything concerning the space race, had to accept the challenge. They beat the Americans with the first manned spaceflight, the first (and for almost twenty more years only) woman in space, the first multicraft flight, and finally &mdash; the first group flight. They left Americans on scorched ground, even if sometimes just by weeks or even days. And in the course of racing the hideous imperialist capitalist to the Silver Globe they achieved one more outstanding success &mdash; the first orbital docking between two manned spacecrafts and a successful orbital crew transfer.</p>
